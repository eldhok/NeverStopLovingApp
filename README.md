Nest is made for connecting Lovers. No Love should remain untold.
As people step into their teenage life they start imagining about love of their life and when they found one, they change themselves for the one they love.No doubt, its 21st century where people are free from old rituals but still there are people who are not able to express their love.

Why people fear to Express Love :

Fear of Rejection:

This is the most common reason which resist people to express their love. Most of the people lose their beloved just because they think that it would be very embarrassing if the girl/boy would say them no. You can’t force anyone to love you and world never ends because of rejection of a person. There can be any reason for rejection like he/she might not know you properly or might be already committed. Thus better overcome the fear of rejection and do express your feeling to whom you love.

Ruin Friendship:

It is always said that friends can make a good pair because they know each other very well and always accept each other with both negative and positive points. When you are in love with someone who is your very good friend, you don’t have to force yourself for adjusting with that person. But if you afraid that if you will propose your friend and he/she will be no more your friend then change your mind. If their is good understanding between you two then she/he will surely understand your feelings and won’t ruin friendship.

Inferiority Complex:

Another reason which you should avoid, many of us think that we are not worth for the person we love or not the kind of person he/she wants to be with. It might be because looks, lifestyle, status or any other thing. But why many of us forget that everyone in this world have uniqueness and no one want to love a clone. So even if you are not same kind of person or lives same kind of life then also there is nothing harm in telling your feelings. May be that person looking for someone opposite, who can complete him/her.

Ego Problems:

These days people are so much materialistic that they just want to show off and flaunt in front of others. I really wonder that people are living for others or for themselves.When it comes to love, keep your ego aside otherwise you always regret that you lost your so called “True love”.
